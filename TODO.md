# Feature goals

* generate tests with yeoman:
  * server responses.
* configure flow or at least jsdoc
  * This is especially important in reducers. We want to make sure that data in and out of reducers are a certain type.
* Support code splitting for more efficient bundles (could also use bundle-loader here).
* Support options for a CSS framework, such as bootstrap or Material UI.

# Additional Repo goals

* Create a publication script that tags github and runs changelog.
  * Run this through travis CI.
