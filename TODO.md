# Goals for Publishing this as  Generator

* compose generators with config options.
* generate tests with yeoman:
  * redux reducers, selectors, and epics.
  * server responses.
  * components.

# Additional Code Quality Goals

* configure flow
  * This is especially important in reducers. We want to make sure that data in and out of reducers are a certain type.
* Support code splitting for more efficient bundles (could also use bundle-loader here).
* Improve flexibility with generator options.
  * Escape any EJS files.

# Goals for Configuration

* Support bootstrap or Material UI.
